Add Folder Icons
================

Add Folder Icons is a small Mac OS X utility that adds generated icons to batches of folders. It is available on the Mac App Store:

Some versions are also available for download and installation manually without the Mac App Store, though since the store is available on all versions of OS X supported by Add Folder Icons (10.6 or later), this is not currently the recommended way to install the software. For more, see:
